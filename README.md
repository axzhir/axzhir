## About Me

I am a **Computer Science student** with hands-on experience in **full-stack development, machine learning, mobile applications, and low-level systems programming**. 

I have delivered **AI-driven software projects** and contributed to **Android application development**.  
My technical background also includes engineering **foundational IT systems on cloud platforms**, building a **Y86-64 Processor Emulator in C**, and gaining exposure to advanced computational concepts through programs at **Cornell Tech and Duke University**.  

Currently, I am seeking challenging **Software Engineering and Machine Learning roles** where I can apply my diverse skillset and passion for continuous learning to build impactful solutions.

I am also a **Quantum Intern at Quantumpedia x QWorld**, selected as one of five interns out of 130+ applicants for a 2025 research project on privacy-preserving quantum machine learning models for financial systems. We are developing an automated quantum-AI framework involving distributed QML, algorithmic trading, and quantum-enhanced protocols, with an upcoming peer-reviewed publication.
